Introduction 

This database provides information about the activities of the university. It works according to the following principle: We have students that have their own accounts in university portal and same works for teacher and stuff members. 

Using all the information provided by the database, you can easily find out in which faculty, course and subjects the student studies and for teacher(lecturer and practice) which subjects they teaches and in which faculty they works. In addition, we have Dorm tables from where we can find out which students live there and Parking tables from where we can find out which employees and students have permission for parking. 

The end user is the students and teachers. Data aging will be handled using the trigger that is in this project.
